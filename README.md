# Improved regular expressions support for Acorn

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/acorn-parse-regexps.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/acorn-parse-regexps)

acorn now supports host-independent parsing of regular expressions out of the box. Just make sure that you use acorn >= 5.5.0 and set ecmaVersion >= 9 if you want to use new regular expression features. This plugin is deprecated.
